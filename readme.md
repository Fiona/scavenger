Scavenger by Fiona
==================

This is [my entry for Ludum Dare 16](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=150) it was created in whole in 48 hours. It got 2nd place overall.

It's a simple space exploration game set in a large debris field.

I have put it on Github for posterity, it's under MIT. I'm unlikely to ever touch the game in future, it's here for prosterity and because someone asked for it.

Production 
==========

It is written in Python with pygame and a little completely defunct library/framework I wrote called pygame-fenix which is included in this repository.

The graphics were drawn in graphics gale.

The music and sound effects were done in Propellerhead's Record.

I wrote a little post-mortem of the game here: [http://justfiona.com/blog/entry/my-ludum-dare-december-2009-entry/](http://justfiona.com/blog/entry/my-ludum-dare-december-2009-entry/)
